# API Specification

> **Canonical source:** This document is a pointer to the full API Reference documentation.

The complete API Reference documentation is located at [`docs/API_REFERENCE.md`](./docs/API_REFERENCE.md).

## Reality Check

> **Current State (2025-01-27):**
> 
> - **No backend server exists today.** This is a frontend-only application.
> - **All persistence is browser-side** using LocalStorage, IndexedDB, and Cache API.
> - **API docs are forward looking.** The canonical API Reference document describes current internal module boundaries and may include forward-looking API designs for potential future backend services.

For internal module boundaries, API types, and integration details, please refer to the canonical document.
